===========================
Introduction to the library
===========================

Write a small to the library here.

You can use the following syntax to include code:

.. plot::
    :context: reset

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> x = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 400)
    >>> y = np.sin(x**2)
    >>> plt.plot(x, y)
    >>> plt.title('A simple chirp')



Factorization
-------------

You can use links `links`_.

.. _links: https://www.wikipedia.org

You can use latex equations:

.. math::
    
    f(x) = \sum_{i=0}^n x_i

Here is an example of inline latex: :math:`g(y)=\frac{1}{y}`.

=========================
List of example notebooks
=========================

Maybe you can simply add a list of example notebooks here. Use symbolic links to the notebooks in the notebooks folder.

.. nbgallery::
   notebooks/start
